                    <b>Comments:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you, Karen, for starting

                    this website for MHS Alumni. Great idea! Memories of the MHS

                    Band are among my favorite -- let's hear it for budding

                    musicians! My husband and I live in California with six cats

                    and one corn snake who is MIA at the moment. I am back in

                    school studying for a master's degree in Library &amp;

                    Information Science after trying on numerous career hats.

                    Does anyone know the whereabouts of Tony Previtera? Some of

                    the MHS Alumni have posted at Reunion.com (just an FYI). I

                    would like to see more of the Class of '76 post their

                    information here. My parents still live in Oakdale.</p>

                    </b>Sorry to hear about the spam problem. This is a real good web sight. It’s a lot easier to find old school friends this way than that reunion.com sight.







Anyway someone else had written, how disappointing it was they could not find more friends from their graduating class. I know how they feel. I found people from my graduating class, but, no one that I hanged with. Well anyway I am married for the 2nd time. The 1st  marriage ended after 16 yrs L. Not my choice. I have two kids; a girl 24, and a boy 21, also 3 grandkids; a girl 6 and two boys 41/2 and 2. I’m remarried and we have three cats ( that are our kids) Cosmos, Misty and

                    Symba. They of course think they are human.



I currently reside in Arizona; and have been here since my divorce in 1999.







Merry Christmas everyone!</p>

Please visit it and update your contact info.  www.mhsclassof1997.com.  It&#39;s FREE!  3)To Melinda Clark in response to your entry: I&#39;m sorry you feel high school was hell for you and if I had any part in making it that way for you, I am sorry!  I do wish you would change your mind about getting in contact with anyone from our class because I would love to hear from you.</p>

I just left this here to let you know I&#39;ve been here and I think the site is well designed.  I&#39;m not looking to contact anyone in my graduating class... high school was hell for me and I&#39;d like to leave it where it belongs, in the past.</p>
