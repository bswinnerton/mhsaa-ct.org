					<br>Saturday, March 8
					<br>6:00 pm
					<br>Groton Lodge of Elks
					<br>(700 Shennecossett Road, Groton)
					<p align="justify">Details: Linda was diagnosed in November 2007 with amyloidosis, a very serious condition that can affect one or more of the body's organ systems.  She will undergo treatment for this affliction at Boston University Medical Center on Feb 05, 2008.   Our goal is to raise $15,000 to help defray the costs associated with her stay in Boston, and to help cover her living expenses as she recovers.
					<p align="justify">The course of treatment will require Linda and her care giver, to rent an efficiency room in Boston for a minimum of 6 weeks.  The Medical Center has supplied a list of available rooms for them, however, the anticipated costs are expected to total $2800/month, and are not covered by insurance.  As a life-long resident of New London County, Linda grew up in Montville and attended Montville Schools. She had worked for many years in the bartending industry and until recently, Linda was a mail carrier for the United States Post Office. She has, over the years, been there for others in their times of need, but now she needs your help.
					<p align="justify">We are now seeking donations from local restaurants and business to provide the necessities to host our family style dinner in support of this effort.  We hope you can join us at this fundraising event.  It is only through your kindness and generosity that we can expect to meet or surpass our goal.
					<p align="justify">If you would like to make a monetary donation, an account has been established: The Linda Oswald Fund c/o Dime Bank. We can proudly say that 100% of the dollars we generate will go toward offsetting Linda's expenses.  Thank you in advance for your consideration and generosity in support of this cause.  Please mail any donations to Linda Oswald, C/O Pat Giulietti, 20 Vartellas Drive, Uncasville, CT 06382. If you would like to purchase tickets, or if you have any questions or require further information, please feel free to give us a call. We will be happy to come to your establishment and pick up any items of donations. We look forward to seeing you on March 8th.
